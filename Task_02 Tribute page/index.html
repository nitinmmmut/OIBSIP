        <h2>The Chief Architect Of The Indian Constitution</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</b> (14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist, social
          reformer and political leader who headed the committee drafting the Constitution of India from the Constituent
          Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, and inspired
          the Dalit Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism.

          Ambedkar graduated from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, and studied economics at Columbia
          University and the London School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923 respectively and was
          among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s.[13] He also trained in
          the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life
          was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for India's
          independence, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing
          significantly to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass
          conversions of Dalits
